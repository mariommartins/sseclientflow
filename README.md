## Technologies
This project was made in Kotlin using the following libs:
- **Hilt**
- **OkHttp_SSE**
- **Coroutines Flow**
- **Compose**
- Gson

## Functionality
This is a single-activity app that opens a SSE connection to a test Server and updates the Composable UI in real-time

## Architecture Notes
- This was built to be maintained for a while.
- This is a multi module project, focused on the Clean Architecture layers, which are structured as follows:

- Domain is divided in two modules, **impl** and **public**. Where the impl has the final classes and the public has the exposed abstractions.
- The architecture used in the presentation layer was MVVM.
- There are some DesignPatterns being used inside the layers of the system, as UseCases, DataSources & Repositories.
- The code design and style was intended to be consistent and reasonable.

## More Details
- This was used as the sample project for a droidcon 2023 talk that can be checked at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aZBKHHjuAkEYtO0UuAugR8ktuk07Bp8u2GelgjrK8BA/edit?usp=sharing)  
- There is a published article on the Medium platform discussing the theme of this Sample project at [this link](https://medium.com/@gutoomota/how-to-build-a-clean-sseclient-flow-69c623fcc9e2)  
- The Api used for testing in this implementation was found publicly in [this repository](https://github.com/manoamaro/another-hacker-news-client)
